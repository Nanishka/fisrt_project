        <h1>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h1>
        <img src="./img/dori.jpg" alt="img" width="250" height="250">
        <p>Oscar Wilde’s only novel is the dreamlike story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty.
        In this celebrated work Wilde forged a devastating portrait of the effects of evil and debauchery on a young aesthete in late-19th-century England.
        Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise:
         As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows
        day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world.</p>

        <p>DON’T MISS BRIDGE OF CLAY, MARKUS ZUSAK’S FIRST NOVEL SINCE THE BOOK THIEF.</p>
        <p>When Death has a story to tell, you listen.

            It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath.
             Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.
            
            Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a
             meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something 
            she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, 
            she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well
             as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.
